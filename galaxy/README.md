# Galaxy

### CDN
The quickest way to use Galaxy is by adding the CDN link inside your project's head tag. For the most part, Galaxy.css is enough for basic Css layouts. However, interactions involving states (dropdowns, responsive nav) will require galaxy.js (it's only 1kb minified).

#### Stylesheet
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://galaxyui.com/galaxy/galaxy.css">`
#### Javascript
`<script src="https://galaxyui.com/galaxy/galaxy.js"></script>`

This will always link to the latest version of Galaxy.

## Getting Started
- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/uikit/uikit/archive/master.zip)

## Building a quick app

Then clone the repo:

Finally, run the Grunt:
